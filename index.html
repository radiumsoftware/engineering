title: Radium Engineering Guidelines

<p>
This page lays down rules of the road for building Radium applications.
They represent everything we've learned building a modern multiplatform
application. They've emerged from years of iterating through product
development. They've emerged especially since we decided to make a
single HTTP API and build all our clients on. A separate set of problems
occur when when you're applications are dependent on HTTP. These
documents catalogue problems and present solutions.

<p>
These are pratices we use everyday. These documents are kept update and new
practices/patterns are added.
